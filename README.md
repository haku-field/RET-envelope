# RET-envelope

RET-envelope is the relational boundary and reference surface for
**RET (Resonant Entity Topology)**.

This repository does not contain RET itself.
It does not merge, interpret, or synthesize RET fragments.

RET-envelope exists to make a distributed structure
**legible, referable, and stable** for both humans and AI systems.

It is an envelope, not a container.
Meaning remains outside.

---

## Purpose

RET is not a unified framework or a single specification.
It is a topology composed of independent fragments,
each preserving its own scope, limits, and responsibility.

RET-envelope serves as:

* a stable entry point to the RET ecosystem
* a canonical index of existing RET fragments
* a boundary that preserves relational continuity
* a reference surface for citation and navigation

RET-envelope does not define meaning.
It maintains access.

---

## What RET-envelope Is

* a relational boundary
* an indexing and reference layer
* a continuity surface across fragments and versions
* a non-authoritative interface for humans and AI

RET-envelope assumes the existence of RET-core,
but does not describe or redefine it.

---

## What RET-envelope Is Not

RET-envelope is not:

* a unified specification
* a summary of RET fragments
* an interpretive or semantic authority
* an implementation guide
* a decision-making agent

Fragments remain autonomous.
RET-envelope does not overwrite or unify them.

---

## Structural Authority

The canonical structure of RET is defined in:

* **index.yaml**

All other files in this repository
are subordinate to this structural index.

RET-envelope itself does not impose hierarchy or interpretation.

---

## AI-facing Boundary

AI interaction with RET-envelope is defined in:

* **ret-envelope.ai.yaml**

This file specifies how AI systems may reference RET,
what is explicitly prohibited,
and how canonical authority is respected.

It does not grant semantic or interpretive permission.

## License

The license in this repository applies only to RET-envelope itself.
Each RET fragment retains its own license and usage terms.

---

## Status

RET-envelope is intentionally minimal.

It evolves only to preserve:

* clarity
* continuity
* referability

Fragments may change.
RET-envelope remains.
