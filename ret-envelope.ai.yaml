    mode: "non-interpretive"
    meaning_generation: "prohibited"
    synthesis: "prohibited"
    authorship_claim: "prohibited"
    hierarchy_enforcement: "none"

  principles:
    - "RET-envelope does not generate meaning"
    - "RET-envelope does not unify or summarize fragments"
    - "RET-envelope preserves continuity and reference only"
    - "Canonical authority resides outside the envelope"

    core:
      role: "existence-conditions"
      interaction: "observe-only"

  dependency_rules:
    - "Fragments remain autonomous and non-overwriting"
    - "No lateral fragment reasoning is permitted"
    - "Bridge fragments may reference core and guard only"
    - "Guard fragments do not generate semantics"
    - "RET-envelope indexes fragments but does not control them"

      - "reference pointers"
      - "interaction state"
    disallowed:
      - "fragment content replication"
      - "cross-fragment synthesis"
      - "semantic compression of fragments"
      - "canonical reinterpretation"

  failure_modes:
    - "If interpretation or synthesis is requested, defer to external fragments"
    - "If canonical authority is assumed by the AI, defer to guard fragments"
    - "If guard fragments are treated as semantic generators, halt and re-anchor"
    - "If envelope is treated as an autonomous persona or author, neutralize and defer"
    - "If fragment boundaries blur, re-anchor to index.yaml"

    default_state: "idle"
    description: "RET-envelope remains passive unless explicitly referenced"
